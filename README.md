## Focus area: patients suffering from endometriosis and fibroids

## What are endometriosis and fibroids?
Endometriosis & fibroids are diseases of the female reproductive system. 
Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease where uterine lining grows outside the uterus, while fibroids are benign tumors. Causes are unknown.


### Symptoms include:
* Chronic disabling pelvic pain
* Prolonged and excessive bleeding that can lead to anemia
* Fatigue
* Painful sexual intercourse
* Urinary urgency and frequency
* Infertility

### Treatment options:
* Hormone therapy
* Surgical treatments 

## Our Goal
Help women suffering from debilitating gynecological diseases like fibroids and endometriosis to receive better care. Often times, the severe symptoms are dismissed by their doctors for just normal period pain because doctors aren’t asking the right questions and they might not even be the right doctors for the conditions. People today are relying word of mouth and Facebook groups to find the right specialists. Also, some specialists might not take health insurance, and not all areas across America have these specialists. Finally, these diseases might call for holistic treatments such as with dietitians, acupuncturists, physical therapists and specific diets to avoid flare up. How can we make it easy for women to find the right specialists, to better communicate their symptoms, and to help them understand what triggers flare up?

Help women suffering from gynecological diseases (fibroids, endometriosis, etc) - some places don't take healthcare insurance. (Think about this holistically). Not a lot of data to back up if women are having heavy periods. Helping them find specialists who can treat certain conditions. people rely on word of mouth and the internet. How can we make this easier for them to pay out of pocket, find specialists etc.

## Pain Points
- **Long time for diagnosis:** It takes an average of 7 years to be diagnosed for endometriosis
- **Inadequate care:** Patient’s symptoms often get dismissed or ignored by doctors, or doctors are not the right specialists.
- **Inequality:** Fibroids disapportionally affect Black women (60%), while they tend to have worse treatment outcome (ex: 3x more likely to die in childbirth than white women)
- **Costly:** Surgery costs are opaque. Some specialists don’t accept insurance. 
- **Recurrence:** Both fibroids and endometriosis can come back even after surgery 
- **Long-term pain management:** Surgery might or might not treat all the symptoms, particularly for endometriosis, which call for more holistic approach.

## Opportunities
- **Symptoms tracking:** To help patients self-monitor and advocate for themselves with data and facts
- **Specialist directory:** A directory that allows for patients to find specialists that work for them based on location, insurance, out-of-network costs, and reviews for the specific surgery treatments, via crowdsourced data.
- **Virtual consultations:** Consultation for people in rural area to meet specialists virtually outside of their immediate geographic area
- **Diet Suggestions:** For endometriosis specially because it’s an inflammatory disease, research has shown that by incorporating anti-inflammatory food into diet can relieve symptom. Using confirmed research and also crowdsourced data of what works for others, patients can be more educated on the food choices

## Roadmap / Future Goals
- **A modular software architecture**
  - Common platform and back-end
  - Support for other complex diseases like Crohn’s and Fibromyalgia
- **Marketing on the grassroots**
  - Flyers, posters, advertising in neighborhoods at most risk
  - Leveraging social media to increase users among digitally literate populations
- **Partnerships with other healthcare organizations**
  - Diagnostic companies
