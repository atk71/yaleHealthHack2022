## Our Goal
Help women suffering from debilitating gynecological diseases like fibroids and endometriosis to receive better care. Often times, the severe symptoms are dismissed by their doctors for just normal period pain because doctors aren’t asking the right questions and they might not even be the right doctors for the conditions. People today are relying word of mouth and Facebook groups to find the right specialists. Also, some specialists might not take health insurance, and not all areas across America have these specialists. Finally, these diseases might call for holistic treatments such as with dietitians, acupuncturists, physical therapists and specific diets to avoid flare up. How can we make it easy for women to find the right specialists, to better communicate their symptoms, and to help them understand what triggers flare up?

## Pain Points

- **Costly:** Surgery costs are opaque. Some specialists don’t accept insurance. 
- **Recurrence:** Both fibroids and endometriosis can come back even after surgery 
- **Long-term pain management:** Surgery might or might not treat all the symptoms, particularly for endometriosis, which call for more holistic approach.

## Opportunities
- **Symptoms tracking:** To help patients self-monitor and advocate for themselves with data and facts
- **Specialist directory:** A directory that allows for patients to find specialists that work for them based on location, insurance, out-of-network costs, and reviews for the specific surgery treatments, via crowdsourced data.
- **Virtual consultations:** Consultation for people in rural area to meet specialists virtually outside of their immediate geographic area
- **Diet Suggestions:** For endometriosis specially because it’s an inflammatory disease, research has shown that by incorporating anti-inflammatory food into diet can relieve symptom. Using confirmed research and also crowdsourced data of what works for others, patients can be more educated on the food choices
